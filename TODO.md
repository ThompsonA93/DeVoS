## Work in Progress
### Todo
- [ ] Further integrate each component
- [ ] Refactor conf-files
- [ ] Testing & Mocking of basic functionality
- [ ] Implementation of Recovery & Fail-Safety Mechanics
- [ ] Vulnerability tests for typical on-chain hacks
- [ ] Deployment tests in the DMZ

### In Progress
- [ ] Create Web-Interface to use JSON-RPC (Metamask?)
- [ ] Improve Smart contracts. Too rudimentary.

### Done 
- [x] Create basic smart contracts
- [x] Checkout local blockchain deployment
- [x] Create Use-Cases for different contracts
- [x] Refactor project from NodeJS to Python3-Flask Provider
  - NodeJS seemed Overkill for this project & too burdensome to setup and run the project on new Hosts.
